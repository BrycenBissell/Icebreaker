Icebreaker is an iOS app that aims to deepen a personal connection between two people. 
These two people can be absolute strangers, best of friends, significant others or anything in between. 
I feel that loneliness is a prominent issue in our society and I hope that through my app people can feel more connected between each other. 
My app is not a solution to loneliness but hopefully it can provide a stepping stone towards that direction.
